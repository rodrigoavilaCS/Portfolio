# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website to showcase projects, skills, and experiences as a backend developer. It also allows potential client collaborations through an email contact form. The site is heavily inspired by Kanish Vâ€™s portfolio. I used his source code as a template in order implement changes that reflect my own content, projects, and styling to serve as my personal portfolio.
